# Quantum Programming Language (QPL) -- PRE-RELEASE

While this project will ultimately be turned into a stand-alone language, initially it is implemented as a python module.

QPL is designed with the philosophy that unitary circuits should not be handled by the programmer,
but rather automatically generated by the language. 
By offering constructs that are translatable to unitary circuits, QPL enables the programmer to work
at the abstract level of desired state transitions. Thus, the programmer deals entirely with Hamiltonian generators,
and never with quantum circuits. By so doing, the language intuitively allows simulation of time-based
processes, or parameterized distributions.
 
For instance, by specifying the transition dynamics of a graph, a random walk on that graph may be produced 
by taking the exponential of the generating Hamiltonian.

## Compiler Architecture

### Execution Flow:
1) User provided code.

2) Initialize Error Manager.

3) Lexical Analyser.

4) Syntax Analyser.

5) Intermediate Code Generator.

6) Code optimizer.

7) Code generator.

8) Assembler.

### Error Manager
The error manager is the only component used throughout all the other stages of compilation.


### Lexical Analyser


### Syntax Analyser


### Intermediate Code Generator


### Code Optimizer


### Code Generator


### Assembler

The assembler takes the optimized output, and produces the executable program.
Initially, QASM will be generated.
